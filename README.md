# multibase_expression_evaluator
Evaluates math in any base up to 36 and outputs result in any base up to 112
Use is self-explanatory. Supports any expression composed of PEMDAS and positive numbers.

Additional info found by running /h in program.

Available as .py or .exe.
If you have Windows, get as .py or .exe. You will need to disable antivirus blocking for the .exe by clicking on the popup and disabling protection. (the library that compiles the program into an exe, auto-py-to-exe, works great but it is a known bug that Windows flags anything compiled with it as a virus).

If you do not have Windows, get as .py, or run .exe in compatibility layer.

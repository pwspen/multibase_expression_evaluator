# multibase_expression_evaluator

Console program that evaluates numbers or math expressions in any base up to 36 and outputs result in any base up to 112

Available as .py or .exe.

If you have Python, get as python and right click -> Open, or double click, to run in terminal.

If you have Windows but no Python, install python or get .exe. You will need to disable antivirus blocking for the .exe by clicking on the popup and disabling protection. (the library that compiles the program into an exe, auto-py-to-exe, works great but it is a known bug that Windows flags anything compiled with it as a virus).

If you do not have Windows nor Python, install python or run .exe in compatibility layer.
